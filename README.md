The Clean Sweep project simulates an intelligent robotic vacuum designed to autonomously navigate and clean a typical household environment. Key features include obstacle avoidance, power management, dirt detection, and sensor simulation, making it a comprehensive system for robotic vacuum functionality.

**Tech Stack**: Spring Boot, JavaFX, Java  
**Architecture**: Modular and scalable, following clean architecture principles for separation of concerns.

## Project Overview
The Clean Sweep system consists of several core modules:

- **Navigation and Control**: The vacuum navigates autonomously, avoiding obstacles and returning to the charging station when power is low.
- **Dirt Detection and Cleaning**: Detects and cleans dirt based on surface type and dirt level.
- **Power Management**: Manages battery levels considering surface types and navigation/cleaning activities.
- **Sensor Simulation**: Simulates real-world sensor data for obstacle detection, surface recognition, and dirt levels.

## Project Structure

### ***BackEnd***
### 1. Common
- **Enums**: Direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), FloorType (BARE_FLOOR, LOW_PILE_CARPET, HIGH_PILE_CARPET).

### 2. Model (Domain)
- **Cell**: Represents a floor map cell, containing floor type, dirt level, and obstacle information.
- **FloorMap**: Represents the floor plan with methods for initialization and loading.

### 3. Controller
- **LogEntryController**: Manages system logs (e.g., movements, cleaning actions, recharging).

### 4. Application (Services)
- **NavigationService**: Controls vacuum navigation using a modified DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithm combined with Dijkstra's algorithm for optimal pathfinding.
- **BatteryService**: Manages battery consumption and recharging.
- **DirtService**: Cleans detected dirt and updates the vacuumâ€™s capacity.
- **SensorSimulatorService**: Simulates sensor behavior for dirt, obstacles, and floor types.

### 5. Infrastructure
- **ActivityLogger**: Logs navigation, dirt cleaned, obstacles, and battery usage.
- **LogEntryRepository**: Persists log entries for system activity history.

### ***Frontend (Visualization)***
- **FloorPlanVisualizer**: Renders the floor map, showing the vacuum, obstacles, and dirt.
- **RobotVisualizer**: Visualizes the vacuum's movements and actions.
- **HUDController**: Displays battery status, dirt level, and system status.

## Key Functionalities
- **DFS Navigation**: Ensures the vacuum systematically moves, avoiding obstacles.
- **Battery Management**: Returns the vacuum to the charging station when power is low.
- **Dirt Detection**: Cleans dirty cells as the vacuum traverses the floor.
- **Sensor Simulation**: Mimics real-world sensor data (e.g., floor types, dirt levels, obstacles).

## Testing
The system is covered by unit tests for all major modules:

- **NavigationServiceTest**: Tests BFS navigation, logging, and battery management.
- **SensorSimulatorServiceTest**: Validates sensor accuracy for dirt, floor type, and obstacles.
- **CleanSweepSystemApplicationTests**: Ensures seamless module integration.

## Resources
- **Application Properties**: Configured in `resources/application.properties` (e.g., grid size, battery capacity, dirt levels).
